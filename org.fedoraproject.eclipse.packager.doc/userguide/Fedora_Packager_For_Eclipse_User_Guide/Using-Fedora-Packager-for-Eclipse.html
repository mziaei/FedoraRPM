		<p>Most of the features of Fedora Packager for Eclipse are accessible via its context menu or keyboard short-cuts. The richest context menu is available if you 
			<a href="Using-Fedora-Packager-for-Eclipse.html#Importing_a_Fedora_Git_Project">imported a Fedora Git package</a>. A subset of this functionality is also available for 
			<a href="Using-Fedora-Packager-for-Eclipse.html#Creating_a_Local_Fedora_RPM_Project">Fedora RPM projects</a>. The former is intended for Fedora package maintainers and the latter is useful for creating a new Fedora package, which is not yet part of the Fedora distribution.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Context Menu</b>
		</p>
		<p>The Fedora Packager context menu should be available if you:</p>
		<dl>
			<dd>1. Right-click on a project which got imported via the

		<p>As mentioned earlier, as of Fedora Packager for Eclipse 0.2 there are two options for creating Fedora packaging projects:</p>
		<dl>
			<dd>1. Importing an existing Fedora Git project. This should be used for package maintenance.</dd>
			<dd>2. Create a new Fedora RPM project for a package not yet in Fedora</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>First, we'll describe how Fedora Packager for Eclipse can be used for creating a new Fedora package. This is handy if you decided to become a new package maintainer (never packaged something for Fedora before) and would like to submit a package for review. It is also useful for existing package maintainers who would like to introduce a new Fedora package. If you'd like to become a new package maintainer, the Fedora RPM Project option of Fedora Packager for Eclipse 0.2, will help you walking you through the process and will make some parts of it easier for you. For existing packager this will help expediting SRPM creation and submitting it for review.</p>

		</p>
		<h2 id="Fedora_Packaging_Work">Fedora Packaging Work</h2>
		<p>After a Fedora Git project has been created, all files required for packaging the desired release can be found in the created Eclipse project directly. For example, files for release Fedora 13 correspond to files present in the Eclipse project, once switched to branch 
			<b>f13</b>. Files in branch 
			<b>master</b> correspond to 
			<b>Fedora rawhide</b>, the current development release of Fedora. All the development should be done in this branch and once it's done you can 
			<a href="Using-Fedora-Packager-for-Eclipse.html#Switching_Branches_.28Git_Checkout.29">checkout</a> to another desired branch and 
			<a href="../../../org.eclipse.egit.doc/help/EGit/User_Guide/Tasks.html?path=9_0_2_8#Rebasing">rebase</a> that branches on top of 
			<b>master</b>. Then push them together to the upstream.
			<br/> 
			The following is a brief description of things to consider doing while packaging up some software. 
		</p>
		<h3 id="Uploading_Source_Files_Required_for_a_Package">Uploading Source Files Required for a Package</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>In order to upload new sources in Fedora Packager for Eclipse, first download upstream sources and place the downloaded sources in the same folder as the Eclipse project. If this is done outside of Eclipse, don't forget to refresh the project afterwards (F5) so that the file actually shows up. A slick way to download sources is to use 
				<a href="Using-Fedora-Packager-for-Eclipse.html#Using_the_Specfile_Editor">Specfile Editor</a> functionality directly. 
			</li>
			<li>Once the new source file is available in the project, it can be uploaded to the lookaside cache by right-clicking on your file, 
				<b>Fedora Packager</b> &gt; 
				<b>Upload This File</b> &gt; 
				<b>Replace/Add Existing Sources</b>. This either adds the file to the sources required to build the package or replaces the current content of the <code>sources</code> file to contain a single line with the MD5 sum of the file selected.
			</li>
			<li>A valid certificate is required to upload to the lookaside cache. If it has expired, a new one can be created by issuing the following command in a terminal:</li>
		</ul>
		<pre>    $ fedora-cert -n
</pre>
		<h3 id="Downloading_Source_Files_Required_for_a_Package">Downloading Source Files Required for a Package</h3>
		<p>To download the required source files for an existing package in order to build it:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Right-click on the .spec file and select 
				<b>Fedora Packager</b> &gt; 
				<b>Download Sources</b>. This downloads all sources listed in the file <code>sources</code>.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="Using_the_Specfile_Editor">Using the Specfile Editor</h3>
		<p>Fedora Packager for Eclipse uses the RPM Specfile Editor and ChangeLog plug-in from the 
			<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/linuxtools">Eclipse Linux Tools project</a>.
			<br/> 
			For instance, a new ChangeLog Entry can easily be created in the .spec file by using the <code>Ctrl+Alt+c</code> keyboard shortcut or by clicking 
			<b>Edit</b> &gt; 
			<b>ChangeLog Entry</b> (though a good idea is to set appropriate 
			<b>
				<a href="../../../org.eclipse.linuxtools.changelog.doc/userguide/ChangeLog Reference.html">ChangeLog Preferences</a>
			</b> first). Also, rpmlint can be run by right-clicking on the .spec file and selecting 
			<b>Run Rpmlint</b>. 
			<br/>
			For more information have a look at the 
			<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/linuxtools/videos/specfile-demo.ogg">.spec file editor screen-cast</a>,  or at the 
			<a href="../../../org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui.editor.doc/userguide/SpecfileEditorReference.html">Specfile Editor User Guide</a>.
		</p>
		<h3 id="Committing_Changes_to_the_Local_Git_Repository">Committing Changes to the Local Git Repository</h3>
		<p>After the .spec file, patches, etc. have been added/changed, commit those changes to the repository. This is done by:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Selecting the files to commit (alternatively select the Fedora Git project and select desired 
				<i>unstaged</i> files when the commit dialog is shown)
			</li>
			<li>Right-click, 
				<b>Team</b> &gt; 
				<b>Commit...</b>
				<br/>
				<br/>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			<img title="Git Commit" alt="Git Commit" border="0" src="images/GitCommit.png"/>
		</p>
		<h3 id="Switching_Branches_.28Git_Checkout.29">Switching Branches (Git Checkout)</h3>
		<p>Switching branches is as easy as double-clicking on the desired local branch to be worked on.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The currently checked-out branch is indicated to the left of the project name. </li>
			<li>Make sure to commit, revert, or stash changes before switching to a different branch. </li>
			<li>Refer to the 
				<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/">Git</a> and 
				<a href="../../../org.eclipse.egit.doc/help/EGit/User_Guide/User-Guide.html">EGit</a> documentation for more information on this.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="Building_the_Package_Locally">Building the Package Locally</h3>
		<h4 id="Preparing_Sources_for_Build">Preparing Sources for Build</h4>
		<p>Fedora Packager for Eclipse will download and prepare sources for building a package.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Select your .spec file, right-click, 
				<b>Fedora Packager</b> &gt; 
				<b>Prepare Sources for Build</b>.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<img title="Prepare Sources for Build" alt="Prepare Sources for Build" border="0" src="images/PrepareSourcesForBuild.png"/>
		</p>
		<h4 id="Building_RPM_for_a_Local_Architecture">Building RPM for a Local Architecture</h4>
		<p>This is a great way to test if the .spec file actually builds at all. Once the RPM has been successfully built locally, it is recommended further testing be carried out on the .spec file by completing a build in a chroot environment using mock. Both ways are supported by Fedora Packager for Eclipse.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>To build the RPM locally right-click on the .spec file and select 
				<b>Fedora Packager</b> &gt; 
				<b>Build for Local Architecture</b>. Output of the RPM build process will appear in the Eclipse Console view.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Using mock to build your package is a great way to verify that you have the correct <code>BuildRequires</code> in a .spec file. </p>
		<ul>
			<li>To build the RPM locally using mock, right-click on the .spec file and select 
				<b>Fedora Packager</b> &gt; 
				<b>Local Build Using Mock</b>. Be aware that this may take a long time and requires the mock package to be installed. Use Eclipse's 
				<i>Run in Background</i> functionality for convenience.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="Make_Locally_Committed_Changes_Public_.28Git_Push.29">Make Locally Committed Changes Public (Git Push)</h3>
		<p>When you are satisfied with your locally-committed changes, you are ready to publish them publicly. Remember, if you made any mistake in your commits, Git allows history to be rewritten before changes are made public. See the 
			<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/">Git</a> and 
			<a href="../../../org.eclipse.egit.doc/help/EGit/User_Guide/User-Guide.html">EGit</a> documentation for more information.

		<h3 id="Pushing_a_Build_to_Koji">Pushing a Build to Koji</h3>
		<p>As of Fedora Packager for Eclipse 0.2 there are three different options of pushing a build to Koji.</p>
		<dl>
			<dd>1. Pushing a regular build</dd>
			<dd>2. Pushing a scratch build (using sources from Git and lookaside cache)</dd>
			<dd>3. Pushing a scratch build for which the user provides the SRPM</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>Using the former two is straight forward. Just keep in mind to Git-push local changes before your trigger either one of the two.</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/EclipseFedoraPackagerPushBuildToKoji.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>The third option works a bit differently, so we'll focus on it. Pushing a scratch build for which the user specifies the SRPM works as follows:</p>
		<dl>
			<dd>1. It checks if an SRPM is present in the current project. If so you can select either one of them and use that for the Koji build.</dd>
			<dd>2. If Fedora Packager for Eclipse can't find an SRPM, it will pop up a file selection dialog so that you can browse to and select any SRPM on your filesystem</dd>
			<dd>3. Once the SRPM has been specified, Fedora Packager for Eclipse will upload this SRPM to Koji and Koji will in turn use that SRPM for the build. It won't use any other sources for the build.</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/EclipseFedoraPackagerSelectSRPMForKojiBuild.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>After either one of the three Koji builds has been triggered, Eclipse will pop up a message dialog containing the Koji URL to track the pushed build. Here is an example of how the message may look:</p>
		<p>
			<img title="Koji Popup Dialog" alt="Koji Popup Dialog" border="0" src="images/KojiBuildPopupMessage.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Also note that there will be a log entry in the Eclipse Error Log view detailing the Koji-Web URL of the pushed task as well. If you click on the provided URL, a browser tab will open in Eclipse showing you the status of the pushed build. Refresh it in order to follow build progress. As of yet, Fedora Packager for Eclipse does not support chain builds.</p>
		<h3 id="Pushing_a_Bodhi_Update">Pushing a Bodhi Update</h3>
		<p>Fedora Packager for Eclipse can be used to push Bodhi updates as well. For example you can use keyboard short-cut <code>CTRL+ALT+F B</code> or the context menu to trigger this action (
			<b>Fedora Packager</b> &gt; 
			<b>Create New Bodhi Update</b>). Before you push a Bodhi update, make sure that all relevant builds have been pushed to Koji. If you attempt to push an update for a build which does not exist, the Bodhi update will fail. The recommended steps prior pushing a Bodhi update are:
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dd>1. Push build to Koji</dd>
			<dd>2. Make sure your local .spec file matches what's in the remote Git repository</dd>
			<dd>3. Right-click on the .spec file of the package you'd like to push an update for</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>After step three the following actions are carried out by the Bodhi update action of Fedora Packager for Eclipse:</p>
		<dl>
			<dd>1. Fedora Packager for Eclipse (FP for short) checks for unpushed changes of the current branch.</dd>
			<dd>2. FP will try to restore saved username and password from Eclipse's secure storage and might therefore prompt for the master password of the secure storage. This only happens if the user ever checked the saved password checkbox of the Bodhi login dialog.</dd>
			<dd>3. FP will ask for your Bodhi credentials (your FAS username and password).</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>
			<img title="Bodhi Credentials Dialog" alt="Bodhi Credentials Dialog" border="0" src="images/FedoraPackagerBodhiCredentialsDialog.png"/>
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dd>4. FP will validate credentials before presenting the update dialog.</dd>
			<dd>5. FP shows the Bodhi update dialog as shown below.</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>
			<img title="Bodhi Update Dialog" alt="Bodhi Update Dialog" border="0" src="images/FedoraPackagerBodhiUpdateDialog.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Arbitrary additional builds may be added to the list of builds via the 
			<b>Add Builds</b> button.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img title="Bodhi Add Builds Dialog" alt="Bodhi Add Builds Dialog" border="0" src="images/FedoraPackagerBodhiAddBuildsDialog.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>In order to push the update select relevant builds in the dialog (use <code>CTRL+Click</code> to select multiple builds) you'd like to push an update for, choose the update type, provide the request type, add an advisory comment for the update and click 
			<b>Save Update</b>. If the Bodhi update was successfully pushed, Fedora Packager for Eclipse will show you a message dialog with a link to an URL where the progress of the update can be tracked.
		</p>

		</p>
		<h2 id="Configure_SSH_in_Eclipse">Configure SSH in Eclipse</h2>
		<p>Before you get started with importing packages from Fedora Git, you should have your FAS SSH keys set up in Eclipse. You should do this because if Fedora Packager for Eclipse finds a <code>~/.fedora.cert</code> file, it will use an SSH based clone URL with your FAS username extracted from this certificate. Note that you'll have the option of cloning anonymously anyway.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, Eclipse can't use your ssh-agent. Our believe is that this is because Eclipse has to run on several platforms (not just Eclipse). Since UNIX sockets are platform dependent, this may be be reason why Eclipse can't use it.</p>
		<p>
			<b>Eclipse SSH Preferences</b>
		</p>
		<p>Press <code>CTRL+3</code>, type "SSH2" and hit return. This should bring you to the following page:</p>
		<p>
			<img title=" Eclipse SSH2 Preference page" alt=" Eclipse SSH2 Preference page" border="0" src="images/EclipseSSHPreferences.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Make sure that your FAS SSH key is listed there and you can successfully unlock your key.</p><hr/>
